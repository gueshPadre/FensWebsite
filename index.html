    <h2>Welcome to F.E.N.S.</h2>
    <p>F.E.N.S. is a safety traveling app that allows travelers to stay safe and know things only locals would know. It also allows you to connect with locals to ask them anything you want about where you're traveling to! Also a great way to make friends! <br> </p>

    <p>F.E.N.S. was created off of a non profit called Flooding Environment of Nurturing Support where we noticed that participants constantly enjoyed and were interested in knowing how safe their neighbourhood was. From that, we built an application that allows you to know what neighbourhood is more or less dangerous when you travel, allowing you to monitor where you walk and what are the potential dangers in the areas you frequent. 
    On top of the knowing the statistics. </p>
